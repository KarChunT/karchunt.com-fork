title: What is Ansible?

## Introduction

<Callout title="Ansible Documentation">
  https://docs.ansible.com/
</Callout>

Ansible is an **open-source automation tool** that **simplifies IT automation**, **configuration management**, and **application deployment**. It is **agentless**, meaning it **does not require any special software to be installed** on the managed nodes. Instead, it **uses SSH to connect** to the managed nodes and execute tasks on them.

Also, it's written in **Python** and uses **YAML** for its playbooks.

## Scenario

### Scenario without Ansible

Imagine you have **10 servers** and you need to install **Git** on all of them. Typically, what you will do is to **SSH** into each server and run the following command:

```bash
ssh user@server1 "sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y"
ssh user@server2 "sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y"
ssh user@server3 "sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y"
ssh user@server4 "sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y"
ssh user@server5 "sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y"
ssh user@server6 "sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y"
ssh user@server7 "sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y"
ssh user@server8 "sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y"
ssh user@server9 "sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y"
ssh user@server10 "sudo apt update && sudo apt install git -y"
```

This is a tedious and time-consuming process. Also, it is prone to human error. If you have **100 servers**, this process will be even more time-consuming and error-prone.

### Scenario with Ansible

Now, let's consider the same scenario with Ansible. You can create a playbook that will install Git on all the servers. The playbook will look like this:

```yaml
- name: Install Git
  hosts: all
  become: yes
  tasks:
    - name: Install Git
      apt:
        name: git
        state: present
```

Now, you can run this playbook using the following command:

```bash
ansible-playbook playbook.yml
```

This will install Git on all the servers in the playbook.

  Without Ansible
  ```bash
  ssh user@server1
  sudo adduser newuser
  ```

  With Ansible
  ```yaml
  - name: Add new user
    hosts: all
    become: yes
    tasks:
      - name: Add new user
        user:
          name: newuser
          state: present
  ```
